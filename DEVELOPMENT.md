# Development Documentation

## Setting Up for Deployment

**Install clasp**

```
$ npm install # clasp is included as a dev dependency
$ npm run clasp -- login
```

**Create your App Script instance**

```
$ npm run create
```

**First push**

```
$ npm run push
```

## Setting Up for Development

To develop this connector you need to follow a couple more steps. They are specifically required to run the
automated tests.

First, follow all steps in **Setting Up for Deployment**. Then:

**Create a GCP project**

Follow the steps listed here: [https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#creating_a_project]

**Get the GCP Project number and ID**

Follow the steps listed here: [https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#identifying_projects]

Record the number and ID somewhere.

**Use the GCP Project number in clasp**

Run:

```
$ npm run clasp -- setting projectId <PROJECT_ID>
```

**Setup OAuth for the GCP Project**

Visit: `https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project=<PROJECT_ID>`.

Set the **Application Name** to `clasp project`. Fill out the required email fields, add your current account
as a test user, then click `Save and continue` until the wizard completes (you don't need to add any scopes).

See instructions here: https://github.com/google/clasp/blob/master/docs/run.md#setup-instructions. Make sure
to run all clasp commands through npm, for example, instead of `clasp setting ...`, `npm run clasp -- setting ...`.

**Set the GCP Project Number in apps script**

Run:

```
$ npm run clasp -- open
```

Click **Project Settings** on the left.

Enter the GCP Project number in **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project** section and save.

**Enable the Apps Script API**

Go to: `https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard?project=<PROJECT_ID>`

Click **Enable APIs & Services** and search for **Apps Script API**.

Click the **Apps Script API** search result and enable the API.

**Create OAuth credentials**

Run:

```
$ npm run clasp -- open --creds
```

Click **Create credentials > OAuth client ID**.

Select **Desktop App** for the application type.

Enter `clasp` for the name.

Click **Create**.

Download the client credentials and save it as creds.json in the root folder (it will be ignored via .gitignore).

Run:

```
$ npm run clasp -- login --creds creds.json
```

Now you'll be able to run the automated tests via `npm test`.

## Useful commands

**Deploy a version**

```
$ npm run clasp -- deploy # marks the current HEAD as a new version
$ npm run clasp -- deployments # prints out existing deployments
```

**Push the current code for manual testing**

```
$ npm run push
```

This command will build and push the code, then print out a link you can use to test the pushed code in Looker Studio.

## Customizing deployments

The connector references several environment variables that can be used to alter its functionality slightly. These
variables are all listed in the root `.env` file of this repository. Changing the values in this file before
building, pushing & deploying will make sure those values are used within the connector in Apps Script.

It is also possible to set these variables directly in the Apps Script settings page. This can be useful for temporary
changes, for example, if you need to enable debug logging.

Values in Apps Script settings will always supercede values define in `.env` files.

## Understanding the effect the connector has on your Matomo

The connector functions by making API requests to your Matomo instance. Depending on how many people use the
connector in conjunction with your Matomo instance, this could be a significant number of added load.

If this is a concern for you, the connector will send the `fromLooker=1` query parameter in every API request it
makes. You can look for API requests with this parameter to see just how much of an effect the looker studio
connector is having.

Note: the name of the parameter (ie, `fromLooker`) can be customized through changing the associated variable
in the root `.env` file.
